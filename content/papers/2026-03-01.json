      "abstract": "The construction of World Models capable of learning, simulating, and reasoning about objective physical laws constitutes a foundational challenge in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence. Recent advancements represented by video generation models like Sora have demonstrated the potential of data-driven scaling laws to approximate physical dynamics, while the emerging Unified Multimodal Model (UMM) offers a promising architectural paradigm for integrating perception, language, and reasoning. Despite these advances, the field still lacks a principled theoretical framework that defines the essential properties requisite for a General World Model. In this paper, we propose that a World Model must be grounded in the Trinity of Consistency: Modal Consistency as the semantic interface, Spatial Consistency as the geometric basis, and Temporal Consistency as the causal engine. Through this tripartite lens, we systematically review the evolution of multimodal learning , revealing a trajectory from loosely coupled specialized modules toward unified architectures that enable the synergistic emergence of internal world simulators. To complement this conceptual framework, we introduce CoW-Bench , a benchmark centered on multi-frame reasoning and generation scenarios. CoW-Bench evaluates both video generation models and UMMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our work establishes a principled pathway toward general world models , clarifying both the limitations of current systems and the architectural requirements for future progress.",

      "abstract": "As Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) scale up and reinforcement learning (RL) methods mature, LMMs have made notable progress in complex reasoning and decision making. Yet training still relies on static data and fixed recipes, making it difficult to diagnose capability blind spots or provide dynamic, targeted reinforcement . Motivated by findings that test driven error exposure and feedback based correction outperform repetitive practice, we propose Diagnostic-driven Progressive Evolution (DPE), a spiral loop where diagnosis steers data generation and reinforcement, and each iteration re-diagnoses the updated model to drive the next round of targeted improvement. DPE has two key components. First, multiple agents annotate and quality control massive unlabeled multimodal data , using tools such as web search and image editing to produce diverse, realistic samples. Second, DPE attributes failures to specific weaknesses, dynamically adjusts the data mixture, and guides agents to generate weakness focused data for targeted reinforcement . Experiments on Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct show stable, continual gains across eleven benchmarks, indicating DPE as a scalable paradigm for continual LMM training under open task distributions.

However, systematic evaluation in real-world mobility settings is hindered by diverse routing demands, non-deterministic mapping services, and limited reproducibility. In this study, we introduce MobilityBench , a scalable benchmark for evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents in real-world mobility scenarios . MobilityBench is constructed from large-scale, anonymized real user queries collected from Amap and covers a broad spectrum of route- planning intents across multiple cities worldwide. To enable reproducible, end-to-end evaluation, we design a deterministic API-replay sandbox that eliminates environmental variance from live services. We further propose a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol centered on outcome validity , complemented by assessments of instruction understanding , planning , tool use , and efficiency . Using MobilityBench , we evaluate multiple LLM-based route-planning agents across diverse real-world mobility scenarios and provide an in-depth analysis of their behaviors and performance. Our findings reveal that current models perform competently on Basic information retrieval and Route Planning tasks, yet struggle considerably with Preference-Constrained Route Planning , underscoring significant room for improvement in personalized mobility applications.

However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e.g., vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities. Constructed via a novel omni-modal event graph approach, OmniGAIA synthesizes complex, multi-hop queries derived from real-world data that require cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration. Furthermore, we propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception . Trained on trajectories synthesized via a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction, OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models. This work marks a step towards next-generation native omni-modal AI assistants for real-world scenarios.",

While recognized as a promising paradigm for visual reasoning , the underlying mechanisms driving its effectiveness remain unclear. Motivated to demystify the true source of its efficacy, we investigate the validity of latent reasoning using Causal Mediation Analysis . We model the process as a causal chain: the input as the treatment, the latent tokens as the mediator, and the final answer as the outcome. Our findings uncover two critical disconnections: (a) Input-Latent Disconnect : dramatic perturbations on the input result in negligible changes to the latent tokens , suggesting that latent tokens do not effectively attend to the input sequence. (b) Latent-Answer Disconnect : perturbations on the latent tokens yield minimal impact on the final answer, indicating the limited causal effect latent tokens imposing on the outcome. Furthermore, extensive probing analysis reveals that latent tokens encode limited visual information and exhibit high similarity. Consequently, we challenge the necessity of latent reasoning and propose a straightforward alternative named CapImagine , which teaches the model to explicitly imagine using text. Experiments on vision-centric benchmarks show that CapImagine significantly outperforms complex latent-space baselines, highlighting the superior potential of visual reasoning through explicit imagination.",

Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool . This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation , while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks. Furthermore, the system exhibits robust generalization and adaptivity, dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty while leveraging context-aware indicators to resolve a wide spectrum of error patterns. Our code and dataset are released at https://github.com/TonySY2/AgentDropoutV2.",

The key ideas are to (i) leverage the conditional and unconditional denoising paths as a new data-partitioning perspective and (ii) adaptively enable optimal pipeline parallelism according to the denoising discrepancy between these two paths. Our framework achieves 2.31times and 2.07times latency reductions on SDXL and SD3, respectively, using two NVIDIA RTX~3090 GPUs, while preserving image quality . This result confirms the generality of our approach across U-Net-based diffusion models and DiT-based flow-matching architectures .
